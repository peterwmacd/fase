## Video plots for ``Latent process models for functional network data''

This folder contains video plots of the ICEWS dynamic network embeddings learned in Section 6 of ``Latent process models for functional network data''.

All 8 dimensions are plotted in pairs: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) and (7,8), with the odd numbered dimension on the x-axis and the even numbered dimension on the y-axis. A progress bar on each plot shows the month of the embedding, and each video will loop through the index space 5 times as it plays.

A selection of countries are labeled, and the points are colored by geographical region. Purple: Africa, Red: Asia-Pacific, Blue: Europe, Cyan: Middle East, Orange: North America, Green: South America.

Due to erratic behavior at the boundaries of the index space, we only plot embeddings from January 2006 to December 2012.
